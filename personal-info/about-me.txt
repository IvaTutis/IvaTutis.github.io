Hey there!
<br/>
I'm Iva, a mathematician that ended up working in software engineering. Couple of things you should know about me:
<br/> 
1. I find it intrinsically reward to produce things for other people to use, be it software, tableware or art.
<br/> 
2. Problem solving brings a lot of dopamine into my ever-hungry system - especially when it involves collaboration.  
<br/> 
Currently I'm making things as being a (currently mid-level) software engineer by mostly working with .NET technologies. 
I ask a lot of questions, enjoy architecting bigger systems and tinkering with my own side-projects. 
I aspire to be a person my mentors would have admired when they were juniors, and this internal type of motivation makes me
 a very relaxed, bright and hardworking person. 
<br/>
Unlike this text which is fairly open-ended and personable, my personality is ambitious, albeit pretty shy and quiet. 
My personal interest - or rather, a thing I would like to do before I die - is uploading intelligence.
