Hey there!
<br/>
I'm Iva, a curious soul who's wandered the realms of mathematics and software engineering, 
finding joy in every line of code and every mathematical puzzle along the way.
<br/> 
Despite having my head in the clouds dreaming about AI and its endless possibilities, 
I keep my feet grounded, working diligently with .NET technologies and growing into a decent software architect.
<br/>
Life's been a rollercoaster of learning, burning out, then rising again with a stronger passion 
for creating something meaningful. 
<br/>
My dream?
<br/> 
To weave together the threads of AI and human creativity, crafting a future where technology and 
imagination blend seamlessly. Outside the matrix, I'm just someone who loves a good challenge,
doubts themselves a bit too much but is always ready to learn and grow. 
Oh, and I'm on a mission to demystify AI, one line of code at a time. 
<br/> 
Let's explore the digital unknown together!
