Hey there!
<br/>
I'm Iva, a mathematician that ended up working in software engineering. Couple of things about me:
<br/> 
1. I find it intrinsically reward to produce things for other people to use, be it software, tableware or art.
Making things brings me into a state of flow, where I don't experience thoughts or time as normal, but instead
my actions and conciousness seem to merge into one. I greatly enjoy this.
<br/> 
2. Problem solving brings a lot of dopamine into my ever-hungry system. Without things to figure out, 
life seems quite monotone in my eyes. I am considered a good, creative problem solver and have trained many years on this. 
I'm no genious - I just really want to crack a problem. My favourite way to solve problems is conversational, be it 
with another engineer, a chatbot or a rubber duck. 
<br/>
Unlike this text which is fairly open-ended and personable, my personality is pretty shy and quiet, albeit ambitious. 
My personal interest - or rather, a thing I would like to do before I die - is uploading intelligence.
<br/> 
Currently I create software as a (currently mid-level) software engineer, mostly working with .NET technologies,
but my mind is somewhat technology agnostic as most systems seem to have similar patterns. 
I aspire to be a person my mentors would have admired when they were juniors, and this internal type of motivation makes me
 a very relaxed, bright and hardworking person. 
 I ask a lot of questions, and enjoy challenges of architecting bigger systems and tinkering with my own side-projects.
